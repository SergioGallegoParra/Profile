## 🚀 About Me


I'm Sergio Gallego Parra, Junior Data Analyst 👨🏻‍💻 and passionate for data as a tool for business decisions 💼. I mostly have been working with VBA in order to automatize administrative process and generating reports through Excel and Power BI, in now I put all my effort to perfect my critical thinking and technical abilities to convert myself in a Expert Data Analyst. 

In this Github repository I want to show you my work and progress analyzing different types of datasets using tools such as Excel, Power BI and, in the near future, Python.
